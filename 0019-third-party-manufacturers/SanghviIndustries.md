Budget and Capital
 
As a successfully running business from the past 25 years we have sufficient capital to support our budgets.We will also be in a very healthy position to raise funds from financial systems if required with a credit score of above 810 out of 900.
 
Risks & Challenges
 
With the current market situation and the pandemic far from over the biggest risk would be shortages of chips worldwide. Logistic delays are another risk with covid restrictions in place in most of the states in India.
 
We want the manufacturers to concentrate entirely on making quality devices while we take care of the Pre orders,logistics and after sale services at minimal margins.
 
BGC-Fi which is an approved distributor of Clodpi manufactured devices in India has been handling pre orders and members of the community in a very unprofessional way along with scalping the prices of the devices.This has lead to trust issues and doubting the credibility of the manufacturer.We at “SANGHVI INDUSTRIES” want to solve this by addressing the community professionally without scalping the prices.
